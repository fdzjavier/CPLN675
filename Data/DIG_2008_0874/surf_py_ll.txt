  Description: 
    Abstract: This is a GIS dataset containing digitized and attributed polygon features from scanned Alberta Geological Survey Maps 201, 202, 203 and 204. The data show the  surficial geology of the Calgary urban area (NTS areas 82O/01, 82P/04, 82J/16 and 82I/13) and are attributed with stratigraphic unit, lithology, lithogenesis, morphology, veneer material and the unit labels as shown on the maps. The data from the four maps are presented in a single polygon layer.
    Purpose: For query and spatial analysis of the surficial geology of NTS areas 82O/01 and 82J/16 and the western halves of NTS  82P/04 and 82I/01.
    Supplemental Information: Compilation of 4 NTS map area (Calgary  82O/01, Dalroy 82P/04, Priddis 82J/16, Dalemead 82I/13.)In English.

Data Quality Information: 
  Attribute Accuracy: 
    Attribute Accuracy Report: L1_LABEL attribute: 5% of the values in this field were checked by examining every 20th record in the attribute table, then comparing values to the source map. Of this subset, less than 2% were found in error, and those errors were corrected. Code 'PS-' as shown on the scan of original paper map was changed to '-PS' based on coding in the map legend. In two instances, code '-PF' as shown on the scan was changed to 'PF' based on coding in the map legend. Other minor discrepancies in the map were adjusted in the dataset under the direction of an Alberta Geological Survey surficial geologist. In addition, unique listings of the domain values for all text fields were generated, then proofread and corrected.
  Logical Consistency Report: The data represents a contiguous set of polygons for the mapped area. As this map is strictly a data conversion of a paper source map, no effort was made to ensure continuity of features with existing surficial data in adjacent study areas (i.e., edgematching).
  Completeness Report: The source maps cover all of map areas 82O/01and 82J/16, but only the western halves of 82P/04 and 82I/13, as that is the only part mapped in the latter 2 areas.
  Positional Accuracy: 
    Horizontal Positional Accuracy: 
      Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report: Horizontal accuracy varies between ±40 and ±60 m, depending on the area. This estimate is based on comparison with provincial 20,000-scale hydrography data.
